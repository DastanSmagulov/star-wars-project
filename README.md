This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install all neccessary dependancies using npm i

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design and Development Process:

Requirements Gathering: The process began with gathering requirements, understanding the project goals, and defining user stories or use cases.

UI Design: Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI were used for styling the application, providing a modern and responsive design.

Development: Next.js, a popular React framework, was chosen for building the frontend of the application due to its server-side rendering capabilities and ease of use. Axios was used for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the backend API.

Deployment: The application was deployed to a hosting platform such as Vercel for public access. Link to visit website is https://star-wars-project-eight.vercel.app/

## Unique Approaches or Methodologies:

Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI: The use of Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI allowed for rapid development of a modern and responsive UI without the need for writing custom CSS. This approach promotes consistency and scalability in the design.

Next.js for Server-Side Rendering: Next.js provides server-side rendering out of the box, improving the performance and SEO of the application by delivering pre-rendered HTML pages to the client.

## Compromises Made:

Simplicity vs. Complexity: A balance was struck between adding features and keeping the application simple and easy to use. Some features may have been deferred or simplified to prioritize the core functionality and user experience.
